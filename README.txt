To set up the project, start by downloading the project files. 
You can either clone the repository from the provided GitHub link
or download the project zip file and extract it to your local machine.
Once you have the files, open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and
use the File > Open Folder option to open the entire project folder.

To run the project, navigate to the main page by locating and opening
`Form.html` in the VS Code sidebar. Fill out the form to 
check the information and validity, including the date picker functionality. 
Finally, test the responsiveness by using VS Code's built-in preview or by 
opening the website in different browsers and devices to ensure it works well across all platforms.
